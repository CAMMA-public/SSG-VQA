## Introduction

The modern operating room is becoming increasingly complex, requiring innovative intra-operative support systems. While the focus of surgical data science has largely been on video analysis, integrating surgical computer vision with natural language capabilities is emerging as a necessity. Our work aims to advance Visual Question Answering (VQA) in the surgical context with scene graph knowledge, addressing two main challenges in the current surgical VQA systems: removing question-condition bias in the surgical VQA dataset and incorporating scene-aware reasoning in the surgical VQA model design.


First, we propose a **S**urgical **S**cene **G**raph-based dataset, SSG-VQA, generated by employing segmentation and detection models on publicly available datasets. We build surgical scene graphs using spatial and action information of instruments and anatomies. These graphs are fed into a question engine, generating diverse QA pairs. Our SSG-VQA dataset provides a more complex, diverse, geometrically grounded, unbiased, and surgical action-oriented dataset compared to existing surgical VQA datasets. We then propose SSG-VQA-Net, a novel surgical VQA model incorporating a lightweight Scene-embedded Interaction Module (SIM), which integrates geometric scene knowledge in the VQA model design by employing cross-attention between the textual and the scene features. 

Our comprehensive analysis of the SSG-VQA dataset shows that SSG-VQA-Net outperforms existing methods across different question types and complexities. We highlight that the primary limitation in the current surgical VQA systems is the lack of scene knowledge to answer complex queries.

# Get started

## Installation
## Environment
You need to have a Anaconda3 installed for the setup. We developed the code on Python 3.8, PyTorch 1.7.1, and CUDA 10.2.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/CAMMA-public/SSG-VQA.git
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ conda activate ssgvqa
```

## Downloads
#### Question-answer pairs
Download question-answer pairs from from our S3 server and unzip it into **./data/qa_txt** folder
```bash
(ssgvqa)$ wget https://s3.unistra.fr/camma_public/github/ssg-qa/ssg-qa.zip
(ssgvqa)$ unzip ssg-qa.zip -d ./data/qa_txt
```
#### Scene Graphs
We provide the scene graph in **scene_graph_ssgqa.zip** in .json format.          
The relationship is a list, where index is the subject of this relationship, and the index is the target, e.g., 'left': [[1, 2], [], []], means the 0 object is to the left of object 1 and 2.            
The image size that bounding boxes are corresponded to is (240, 430)   
#### Visual features
-  (Recommended) Download the features to train and test the model from our S3 server and unzip the files into folder **./data/visual_feats** folder   

```bash
(ssgvqa)$ wget https://s3.unistra.fr/camma_public/github/ssg-qa/cropped_images.zip
(ssgvqa)$ wget https://s3.unistra.fr/camma_public/github/ssg-qa/roi_yolo_coord.zip
(ssgvqa)$ unzip cropped_images.zip -d ./data/visual_feats
(ssgvqa)$ unzip roi_yolo_coord.zip -d ./data/visual_feats
```

- Or, create the features by yourself using the images from public [CholecT45](http://camma.u-strasbg.fr/datasets): 
```bash
(ssgvqa)$ python utils/feat_extract_visual.py
(ssgvqa)$ python utils/feature_extract_roi.py
```
### Model weights for the SSG-VQA-Net
Place the model weights in the [`checkpoints`](./checkpoints) directory
|   Model      |  Model Weights |
| :----------: | :-----:   |
| SSG-VQA-Net| [download](https://s3.unistra.fr/camma_public/github/ssg-qa/ssg-qa-net.pth.tar) |

#### Directory structure should look as follows.

```
# checkpoints: this is the folder in which all the weights are saved.           
# data: this is the folder in which in which all the the pre-extracted features are saved.
